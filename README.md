# Vatansoftcase
I am Ä°ntended to solve a tester case given by Vatansoft as a tester candidate. 

While solving this case, I will write down some basic information about HTTP and provide explanations for parts of the code.

HTTP
HTTP is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It enables communication between a client (e.g., web browser) and a server by following a request-response model.


Key Features

    Stateless: Each HTTP request is independent; the server does not retain any information about previous requests.
    Text-Based: HTTP messages are human-readable, consisting of request/response headers and an optional body.
    Layered Protocol: It operates on top of TCP/IP for reliable communication.

HTTP Methods

    GET: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., fetch a web page or API response).
    POST: Send data to the server to create or update a resource.
    PUT: Update an existing resource.
    DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
    HEAD: Retrieve only headers, not the actual content.
    OPTIONS: Describe the available communication options for the resource.

    
 HTTP Status Codes

    2xx: Success (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created)
    3xx: Redirection (e.g., 301 Moved Permanently, 304 Not Modified)
    4xx: Client Errors (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)
    5xx: Server Errors (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable)

I hope this file finds you well and the text has been helpful to you.
